## 🧪 API Testing (Postman)

A Postman Collection is available in the `postman/` directory:


To test:
1. Import the collection in Postman.
2. Use **Basic Auth** → Username & Password of registered user.
3. Test `/wallet/balance`, `/wallet/recharge`, and `/wallet/withdraw` endpoints.

## 🔐 Authentication

- Basic Auth is used to protect wallet endpoints.
- Every request requires valid `username:password`.
- Only the owner of a wallet can operate on it.

---

## 🧮 Race Condition Handling

- Optimistic Locking via `@Version` field in `Wallet` entity.
- `@Transactional` ensures atomicity for concurrent operations.
- Concurrency tested with parallel threads in JUnit.
